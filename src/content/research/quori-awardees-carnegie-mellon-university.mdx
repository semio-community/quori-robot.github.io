## Project Overview

The Carnegie Mellon University team investigates how Quori's mobility and multimodal expressiveness can support social behavior and communication across diverse users, robot configurations, and environments.

## Research Thrusts

- Nonverbal communication for social navigation
- Teachable social robot peers for math education
- Inter-robot social interaction for heterogeneous service robots
- Interaction design for agent embodiment in multi-agent systems

## Community Contribution

The project aims to deliver reusable software components and design feedback that can be shared across the broader Quori community.
