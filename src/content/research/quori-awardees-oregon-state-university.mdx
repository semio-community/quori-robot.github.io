## Project Overview

The Oregon State University team investigates how Quori can support research on infectious disease response, perceptions of robot capability, and privacy over long-term interaction, while integrating the platform into education and research training.

## Research Thrusts

- Investigation of robotics and automation for treatment of highly infectious diseases
- Study of how people form opinions about robot capability across different tasks
- Study of long-term privacy concerns and how they evolve over time
- Integration of Quori into NSF-funded REU programming and cross-disciplinary robotics and psychology collaborations

## Community Contribution

As a core ROS community hub, the team plans to share software and educational practices that can benefit the broader Quori and HRI communities.
