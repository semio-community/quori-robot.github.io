## Project Overview

The University of Pennsylvania Modlab team extends the Quori collaboration that originated under NSF grant CNS-1513275 and CNS-1513108, focusing on low-cost approaches that lower barriers to real-world HRI research.

## Research Focus

The project emphasizes accessible social robot platforms and practical deployment considerations that can benefit both the Quori community and the broader HRI field.
