## Project Overview

The USC Interaction Lab focuses on socially assistive robotics, developing computational models and behaviors that enable Quori to interact helpfully with diverse populations in real-world contexts.

## Research Directions

- Multimodal interaction modeling and understanding
- Embodied communication for expressive interaction
- Shaping social dynamics such as trust, empathy, and motivation
- Learning user models for long-term interaction

## Community Impact

The project advances best practices for long-term interaction with older adults and children with autism spectrum disorders while expanding Quori's interaction capabilities.
