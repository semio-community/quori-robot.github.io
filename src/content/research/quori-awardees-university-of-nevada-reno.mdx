## Project Overview

The University of Nevada, Reno team investigates socially-aware navigation and mid-torso actuation to better understand how movement and body language influence perceived social intelligence.

## Research Thrusts

- Socially-aware navigation
- Empirical study of HRI involving movement and mid-torso actuation
- Collaborative interaction in home, office, hospital, and education environments

## Evaluation Plan

Empirical studies will evaluate intent through body language, morphological aspects of robot design, and relationships between navigation behavior and perceived social intelligence.
