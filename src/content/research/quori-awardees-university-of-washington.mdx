## Project Overview

The University of Washington team investigates Quori as a therapeutic, stress-reducing social robot, leveraging its expressive motion and projected face to support studies in real-world environments.

## Proposed Studies

- Foundational studies of adolescent-robot interaction
- Experimental comparison of data gathering, empathetic interaction, and stress intervention
- Longitudinal ethnographic study comparing multiple robots deployed in the wild
