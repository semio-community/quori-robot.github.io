## Project Overview

The Johns Hopkins University and Hospital team focuses on affective interaction, mobility coaching, and long-term deployments of Quori to study social engagement and physical activity for older adults in naturalistic settings.

## Research Thrusts

- Affective interaction to promote meaningful social engagement
- Mobility coaching to foster physical activity
- Field deployment to study naturalistic and long-term effects

## Expected Outcomes

The project targets new datasets, models, and empirical evidence that improve social engagement, navigation, and real-world deployments of social robots.
