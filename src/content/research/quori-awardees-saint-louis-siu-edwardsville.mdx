## Project Overview

The Saint Louis University and Southern Illinois University Edwardsville team focuses on arm and face expressivity for Quori, including modular manipulator design and coordinated face-arm behaviors that convey personality.

## Research Thrusts

- Guidelines for manipulator (arm/hand) design and modularity
- Rendering human facial expressions on Quori
- Mapping facial expressions and arm motions together for personality embodiment

## Evaluation Plan

The team plans to extend an existing user study to assess new arm designs and motion retargeting software, with additional participants using Quori as part of the evaluation.
